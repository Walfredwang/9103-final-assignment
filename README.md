In my design, I started by modifying the colors, I explained my understanding of life from another perspective. Life can be covered by 3 colors, white for joy, black for difficulty and gray for the contradiction and uncertainty. My main inspiration is the two regular patterns below. In my design, each circle can represent a separate person, and the cursor is like a force of destiny pushing different people to intertwine and overlap. When the force subsides, people get back on track.Each circle is similar in terms of pattern and shape, but the colors are impossible to make identical, just as people are different from each other.

The interactions

1. use the curor touch the circles, it will move away and When you remove the cursor, it returns to its previous position.

2. when user pressed the mouse and hold, the dashcircle will rotating in the large circle, when release the mouse, it will stop.

3. gradient color, when user pressed the space bar, it will change the color from grey to gradient.
